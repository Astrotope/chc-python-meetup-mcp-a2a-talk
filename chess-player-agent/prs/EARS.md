## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

#### REQ-AGT-001: Stateless Operation
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall not maintain any game state between requests.

#### REQ-AGT-002: Single Responsibility
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall accept a FEN string as input and return the best move in UCI notation as output.

#### REQ-AGT-003: Move Generation Method
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall provide a single generate_move method that takes a FEN string and returns a ChessMoveResponse.

### Input Validation

#### REQ-AGT-004: FEN Validation
**When** receiving a FEN string, the chess player agent shall validate the FEN using MCP server tools before processing.

#### REQ-AGT-005: Invalid FEN Handling
**If** an invalid FEN string is provided, **then** the chess player agent shall return an error response without attempting move generation.

### Move Generation Process

#### REQ-AGT-006: Engine Integration
**When** generating a move, the chess player agent shall use the get_stockfish_move tool via MCP server to determine the best move.

#### REQ-AGT-007: Move Validation
**When** receiving a UCI move from Stockfish, the chess player agent shall validate the move is legal for the given position using MCP server tools.

#### REQ-AGT-008: Move Validation
**When** a move is generated, the chess player agent shall validate the move is legal for the given position before returning it.

### Output Requirements

#### REQ-AGT-009: UCI Format Output
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall return moves in Universal Chess Interface (UCI) notation (e.g., "e2e4").

#### REQ-AGT-010: Response Structure
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall return the best move as a string in UCI notation.

### Error Handling

#### REQ-AGT-012: MCP Server Unavailable
**If** the MCP server is unavailable, **then** the chess player agent shall return an error response indicating server connectivity issues.

#### REQ-AGT-013: Engine Failure
**If** the Stockfish engine fails via MCP server, **then** the chess player agent shall return an error response indicating engine unavailability.

#### REQ-AGT-014: Invalid Move Generation
**If** no valid move can be generated, **then** the chess player agent shall return an error response with diagnostic information.

### Performance Requirements

#### REQ-AGT-015: Response Time
**When** processing a move generation request, the chess player agent shall respond within 10 seconds under normal operating conditions.

### Integration Requirements

#### REQ-AGT-016: MCP Client
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall use MCP client to communicate with the chess MCP server for all chess operations.

#### REQ-AGT-017: Tool Dependencies
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall depend on the following MCP server tools: validate_fen, get_stockfish_move, validate_move.

### Data Format Requirements

#### REQ-AGT-018: Input Format
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall accept chess positions in Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) format as input.

#### REQ-AGT-019: Output Format
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall return chess moves in Universal Chess Interface (UCI) notation as output.

### Reliability Requirements

#### REQ-AGT-020: Pure Function Behavior
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall behave as a pure function where identical FEN inputs produce identical move outputs.

#### REQ-AGT-021: No Side Effects
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall not modify any external state or maintain internal state between method calls.

#### REQ-AGT-022: Thread Safety
**While** handling concurrent requests, the chess player agent shall process each request independently without shared state.

### Deployment Requirements

#### REQ-AGT-023: HTTP Health Check Endpoint
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall provide an HTTP health check endpoint at `/health` that returns a 2XX status code when the agent is operational.

#### REQ-AGT-024: Health Check Response
**When** the health check endpoint is accessed via GET request, the chess player agent shall return status 200 with no authentication required.

#### REQ-AGT-025: Health Check Content
**When** returning a health check response, the chess player agent shall include agent status and MCP server connectivity in the response body.

#### REQ-AGT-026: Health Check Availability
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall respond to health check requests within 5 seconds to meet deployment requirements.

#### REQ-AGT-027: Docker Containerization
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall be packaged in a Docker container for deployment.

#### REQ-AGT-028: Docker Port Exposure
**When** running in a Docker container, the chess player agent shall expose the HTTP port for external access.

#### REQ-AGT-029: Docker Environment Configuration
**When** deployed via Docker, the chess player agent shall accept configuration via environment variables including MCP server URL and API keys.

### Environment Configuration

#### REQ-AGT-030: Environment File Loading
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall load configuration from a `.env` file located in the component root directory using the dotenv library.

#### REQ-AGT-031: Environment Variable Support
**Ubiquitous**: The chess player agent shall support the following environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI service
- `CHESS_MCP_SERVER_URL`: URL of chess MCP server (default: http://localhost:5000/mcp)
- `AGENT_MODEL`: OpenAI model to use (default: openai:gpt-4o)
- `AGENT_NAME`: Name of the agent (default: chess-player-agent)
- `AGENT_PORT`: Port for A2A HTTP server (default: 5001)
- `AGENT_HOST`: Host address for server binding (default: 0.0.0.0)

#### REQ-AGT-032: Environment Variable Precedence
**When** both .env file and system environment variables are present, the chess player agent shall prioritize system environment variables over .env file values.

#### REQ-AGT-033: Default Values
**When** environment variables are not provided, the chess player agent shall use sensible default values for all configuration parameters.
